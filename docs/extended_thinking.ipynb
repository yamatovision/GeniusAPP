    "\n",
    "Extended thinking gives Claude 3.7 Sonnet enhanced reasoning capabilities for complex tasks, while also providing transparency into its step-by-step thought process before it delivers its final answer. When extended thinking is turned on, Claude creates `thinking` content blocks where it outputs its internal reasoning. Claude incorporates insights from this reasoning before crafting a final response. For more information on extended thinking, see our [documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/extended-thinking)."
