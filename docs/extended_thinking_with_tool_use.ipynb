    "This notebook demonstrates how to use Claude 3.7 Sonnet's extended thinking feature with tools. The extended thinking feature allows you to see Claude's step-by-step thinking before it provides a final answer, providing transparency into how it decides which tools to use and how it interprets tool results.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using extended thinking with tool use, the model will show its thinking before making tool requests, but not repeat the thinking process after receiving tool results. Claude will not output another thinking block until after the next non-`tool_result` `user` turn. For more information on extended thinking, see our [documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/extended-thinking)."

    "This notebook shows how to combine Claude's extended thinking feature with tool use. Key benefits include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Transparency into Claude's thinking process when using tools\n",
    "2. Visibility into how Claude decides when to use tools versus internal knowledge\n",
    "3. Better understanding of multi-step tasks that involve multiple tool calls\n",
    "4. Insight into how Claude interprets tool results and incorporates them into responses\n",
    "\n",
    "When using extended thinking with tools, keep in mind:\n",
    "- Set appropriate thinking budgets for complex tasks (minimum 1,024 tokens)\n",
    "- Always preserve thinking blocks and their signatures when passing tool results\n",
    "- Include both normal and redacted thinking blocks in the conversation history\n",
    "- Ensure that system prompts, tools, and thinking configurations match between calls\n",
    "- Expect that tool result turns will not contain additional thinking blocks\n",
    "- Tool use and thinking together can increase token usage and response time"
